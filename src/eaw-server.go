/* 
	This is the main Go file for Empires At War, server edition.

	The server provides a control interface to start a new game.

	As players are added to the game, channels are created to communicate with each player.

	The server must maintain a Websocket on the other end of the player channel.
		Instead of a console-channel-io module, try a websocket-channel-io module
		TODO how would a Websocket server work to be able to connect the channel?

/*
 * The expected sequence for the game server to get a new game going is:
	
	1. Client calls server to create a new game
		a. server calls game.NewGame; return the game ID to the client
		b. server calls Game.AddPlayer to add the first player
		c. return the game ID to the client
	2. Client calls server with game ID to join game
		a. server calls game.GetGame(gameID) to retrieve game instance
		b. if not found, return error to the client
		c. server calls Game.AddPlayer to add the new player
	3. Client calls server with game ID to start game
		a. server calls game.GetGame(gameID) to retreive game instance
		b. if not found, return error to the client
		c. server calls Game.StartGame
